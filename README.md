# Tailwind CSS Custom Color Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with custom colors in Tailwind CSS. The problem is that a custom color defined in `tailwind.config.js` does not get applied to elements in the HTML.

## Bug Description
The custom color `custom-color` is defined in `tailwind.config.js`, but it does not apply to the div element in `index.html`. This is likely due to a configuration problem or a missing step in the Tailwind CSS setup process.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` includes the correct paths to your HTML and component files.  The `index.html` file should be explicitly listed, and the `src` directory should be included to handle components.  Ensure that your project structure matches the configuration.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start a development server (e.g., using Vite or Webpack). 
4. Observe that the div element does not have the expected background color.
